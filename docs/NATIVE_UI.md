# Native UI: drawing the menu the way the game draws its own

Goal: the menu, the watches and the input display look like the game's own UI (its font, its button glyphs, its dark
info boxes and bands), instead of gz's pixel font in opaque boxes. Work in progress on the `native-ui` branch.

## Approach

Draw with the GPU, just before the game's present (where `nvn.c` copies the panels in today), using the game's own UI
shader, font and textures, all loaded from the game's RomFS at start-up:

- **Same pixels as the game's UI**: the shader the game draws its menus with, its textures and its font.
- **Works when the game doesn't run**: drawn at present time, not in the game's frame, so it can keep working while the
  game is held (pause, frame advance), in loading screens and cutscenes.
- **No new game addresses**: the shader, font and textures come from files; NVN comes through the `nvnBootstrapLoader`
  hook `got.c` already has. The same code serves 1.0.0, 1.1.1 and later updates.
- **Nothing in the game changes**: no state in the game's UI system. Memory comes from the game's heap at start-up
  (fonts, shader, GPU buffers, and the game's pictures: about 15 MB for a few seconds the first time they're made,
  6.4 MB kept; later starts read them from the SD card).
- **Anything can be drawn**: gz's checkboxes, the memory viewer, the keyboard, the collision view (lines, which the
  copy path can't draw).

Driving the game's own UI library (Layout2) instead was looked at and set aside: it has ready-made parts
(`PaOptionBtn`, `PaOptionBtnLevel`, `PaNumberArrow`, `PaScrollBar`, `PaGuideKey`...), but main has no symbols or RTTI
for it, its layouts (`.buil`, magic `BFFH`) have no public tools, every function would need an address per game
version, it allocates in the game, and it updates and draws inside the game's frame, so it would freeze exactly when
the menu is used during pause and frame advance.

Nothing from the game goes into this repository or a release: the module reads the user's own game files.

## What the game provides

All under RomFS. `.zs` files are zstd with the dictionaries in `Pack/ZsDic.pack.zs` (a zstd SARC of `*.zsdic`;
the frame header names the dictionary: 1 = `zs.zsdic` for the files below).

| What | File | Format |
|---|---|---|
| UI font | `Font2/Scalable/ClarimoUDPE-Regular.Nin_Ounce_NVN2.bfotf.zs`, `-DemiBold`, `-Light` | scrambled OpenType (CFF, `OTTO`) |
| Button glyphs | `Font2/Scalable/External.Nin_Ounce_NVN2.bfotf.zs` | scrambled OpenType, private use area |
| Zelda glyphs | `Font2/Scalable/Nin-ZeldaGlyphs-v3-Plain.Nin_Ounce_NVN2.bfotf.zs` | scrambled OpenType |
| UI shader | `Layout2Shader/MergeShader.Product.100.Nin_Ounce_NVN2.bfsha.zs` | BFSHA 9.1.1, one BNSH |
| UI textures | `UI/Layout2Archive/Common.Product.100.Nin_Ounce_NVN2.bntx.zs` (65 MB, 244 MB unpacked, no dictionary, 8 MiB window) | BNTX, platform tag `Ounc`, 878 textures |
| UI layouts | `UI/Layout2Archive/Common.Product.100.Nin_Ounce_NVN2.blarc.zs` | SARC of `.buil` (`BFFH`), 157 layouts and parts |

**Font scramble**: `u32 magic, u32 size, font`, all big-endian words XORed with one key. The key is
`word1 ^ (file size - 8)`; `word0 ^ key` is then `0x7F9A0218`. For this game's fonts the key is `0xA6018502`.

**Button glyphs** (`External`): A `U+E040`, B `E041`, X `E042`, Y `E043`, L `E044`, R `E045`, ZL `E046`, ZR `E047`,
power `E048`, D-pad `E049`, HOME `E04A`, + `E04B`, − `E04C`; the sticks with a direction, left then right:
down `E050`/`E051`, up `E052`/`E053`, left-right `E054`/`E055`, press `E056`/`E057`, right `E058`/`E059`,
left `E05A`/`E05B`, up-down `E05C`/`E05D`, plain `E05E`/`E05F`; D-pad up, down, left, right, up-down, left-right
`E060`-`E065`; arrows `E083`-`E08E`, close `E08F`, Triforce badge `E090`. That is the whole set: the font has 261
glyphs, but the unmapped ones are empty. There is one set for every controller (L and R as wide shoulder shapes, the
D-pad as four circles even on the Pro Controller), as the game shows them.

**Controller pictures** (in `Common.bntx`): `Controller_Pro`, `Controller_Grip` (two Joy-Con 2 in the grip) and
`Controller_Console` (handheld), 1160x680 ASTC 4x4 (sRGB), each with a darker, warm-tinted `...1` variant of the same
picture; `ControllerSh_*1` (BC4 shadows) and `ControllerGuide_*_00`-`04` (BC4, the controls screen's leader lines).
All Switch 2 hardware. The options menu's parts: `OptionBtnThinCursorLine_00` / `Glow_00` (BC4 masks, 640x173;
the game draws them round the selected control). The line's picture is a distance field: a bar whose alpha climbs
evenly from 30 px in from its edge to full 29 px further in, and the game cuts a crisp line out of it at a level.
So does this: the alpha mapped steeply round level 0.3 (`gpuui_image_mapped`, the shader clamps it), the picture
cut in nine at 48 px with its middle left out, scaled so the line is 1.6 font pixels thick, its middle on the
row's edges, with the same room round what's selected left and right as the row leaves above and below its
capitals. The glow's picture is a soft bar (nothing 14 px in, full at 72): cut at 72 it's a halo from the line
out, drawn blue-white as the game's. The options' cursor on full-size buttons (`PaOptionBtn_00`, a Layout2
`.buil` in `Common.blarc`) also has a ray effect (`CursorCmnRay_00` over `Kumo64` noise) left out here., `ScrollBar_00` / `ScrollBarBase_00` (ASTC; the thumb,
a grey grain the game maps to orange, on a dark track left of the list); `OptionCheckMark_00` is a corner mark, not a
tick. `SystemLine_00` (BC4 mask, 240x43): a curl, then a line tapering in by about 0.6 of it, the ornament the
game's info boxes have under their title (mirrored at the other end). The info box itself (an item's description
on the pause screen) is near black at about 78% over the game, with hard edges; `MenuMessageBase_00` is its mask. In the BNTX, a
texture record (`BRTI`) has its format at +0x1c, size at
+0x24, packaged layout (8 bytes, for `nvnTextureBuilderSetPackagedTextureLayout`) at +0x34, data size at +0x50, name
at +0x60, levels' data offsets at +0x70, channel sources at +0x58 (NVN's swizzle values); the data is
block-linear as the GPU reads it.

## The UI shader (`MergeShader`, shading model `ui`)

121 programs, chosen by 55 static options (`PaneType`, `Texture_ActiveCount`, `Texture_<n>_<n+1>_BlendColor`,
`SlicingType<n>`, `o_IsProceduralShapeEnabled`, `o_IsProceduralShapeRoundedCornerEnabled`,
`o_IsProceduralShapeInnerShadowEnabled`, `o_IsCaptureEffectBlurType`, `o_TextureMappingType<n>`,
`o_OpacityToColorMode`...). Its interface:

- attributes `_p0` (position), `_u0` (texture coordinate);
- uniform blocks `view` (144 bytes), `UiMaterial` (64), `proceduralshapeshadow` (64: params, colour, attenuation),
  `CaptureEffectBlur` (256), `UiMaterialFont` (16);
- storage buffers `UiMaterialBuffer`, `textCharacterParam` (text is drawn per character from it);
- samplers `sysTextureSampler0`-`5`, `sysTextureSamplerOptional`, `sysTextureSamplerOptionalBitmap`.

## Status

**settings > style: the game's** (the default; `menu_style=0` in `settings.ini`, gz's pixel font is `1`).

- `gamefile.c` reads `content:` files and decompresses `.zs` with the game's dictionaries (`zstd.c`: zstd's
  educational decoder, errors jump back instead of exiting; big files a block at a time through their window,
  `zstd_stream_t`).
- `gamefont.c` loads Clarimo UD PE (regular, DemiBold) and External at start-up (game thread, about 4 ms) and
  rasterises glyphs with stb_truetype on the render thread.
- `uishader.c` loads `MergeShader` and finds two programs by their options' values (a quad in its corner colours;
  a texture times them). `gpuui.c` draws with them in nvn.c's present hook: quads, glyphs from an atlas, shapes
  painted once into the atlas, and the game's pictures as textures from their packaged data. The interface it found
  is at the top of `gpuui.c`.
- `nativeui.c` lays the panels out. The menu by what its rows are (`gfx_row`):
  - text set with its capitals centred in its row, as the game sets a button's (descenders hang below), and
    checkboxes, chevrons and glyphs on that middle;
  - the breadcrumb in the game's gold over the game's ornament line (`SystemLine`, a curl at each end); headings
    with a rule; taller item rows;
  - values in a column after the longest label, between chevrons; a chevron for what opens a menu; buttons named
    in labels and values ("(R + d-up)", "< L >") and in the hint as the game's glyphs;
  - the hint (`gfx_hint`) wrapped by its own type in the rows menu.c keeps for it, and no hint area in a menu
    that has no hints; a heading never ends the visible list;
  - the game's options cursor round the selected item, or the selected part of it (`OptionBtnThinCursorLine` /
    `Glow` as frames); the game's scroll bar left of a list that scrolls (`ScrollBar` / `ScrollBarBase`), its
    thumb inside the track with its grain mapped to two golds (`gpuui_image_mapped`, as the game's materials map a
    picture's black and white to two colours);
  - the controls at its foot as the game's guides have them, "select [L]  return [R]+[D-left]  close [R]+[R-stick
    down]";
  - lines whose columns matter (the memory viewer, the keyboard, typed digits: `menu_item_t.grid`) keep gz's grid.
  The menu sits in a box as the game's info boxes: near black, solid, hard edges, a padding round what's in it.
  Its opacity is the background opacity setting on a curve (1 - (1 - o)^2) that puts the default 60% at 84%,
  about the game's box. The menu is as wide as what's in it.
  The watches: labels dim, values right-aligned. The log fades row by row. The watches sit on a band as the game's
  control guide (`CtrlGuideBG`): fading out left and right, its top and bottom straight, at the background
  opacity setting; the panel is the band, and what's in it keeps a padding to where the band starts to fade.
- Motion: the menu keeps its top-left corner. Going into a menu or back, its box grows or shrinks to the new
  size (180 ms) while the old menu fades out (90 ms) and the new one fades in with an 8-pixel slide from where it
  came (170 ms), on a strong ease-out, taken up from where it is when the next change comes first. Opening and
  closing the menu and moving in a list don't move (they're done all the time).
- The input display (controller style) shows the game's picture of the controller in use (`input_controller`: the
  npad style a button or a stick well off centre came from last), on the watches' band when its background
  option is on (`input_display_background`), else on the game's picture alone. The sticks' caps move
  with the tilt (cut from the picture a row of pixels at a time, their place filled with the grey under them) and
  look pushed in while clicked, their tilt written under them; what's held is lit in its own shape (the Pro
  Controller's cross arms and shoulder bands, round buttons as discs); ZL and ZR, which the pictures don't show,
  are the game's glyphs above it, and so are the Joy-Cons' L and R (a thin line at their top edge in the
  pictures). GL and GR are the system's to assign (`nn::hid::GetGlGrButtonConfigState`): pressed, they light the
  button they're set to. Buttons this module doesn't know are logged once, to learn on a console whether a game
  ever sees them as their own.
- `gameimage.c` loads the game's pictures (the controllers, the cursor, the scroll bar, the ornament line) from `Common.bntx` a few
  milliseconds each frame from start-up (about 160 MB unpacked, until the last of them; 0.37 s in all on a Mac).
  Until then the menu has its own selection band, a plain line under its title and ^ / v marks, and the input
  display its glyphs.
- The items' icons (`UI/Tex/Icon/<name>.bntx.zs`, one ASTC 4x4 texture each, 341 to 1366 px, about 18 MB
  in all) would take more of the game's heap than it has to spare (it refused them past about 11 MB). So
  `gameimage.c` decodes each as it's read (`astc.c`, the LDR part of texture2ddecoder's ASTC decoder, checked
  pixel for pixel against it), puts its blocks in place and shrinks it to 64 px into one RGBA atlas (8 x 9
  slots, 2.5 MB with its texture), which gpuui brings up as slots fill. The packaged layout is block linear:
  GOBs of 64 bytes x 8 rows, 2^layout[0] of them stacked in each column; on the Switch 2 (BNTX platform
  "Ounc") a GOB's 16-byte sectors go row bits 0-1, column bit 0, row bit 2, column bit 1 (Switch 1: row 0,
  column 0, rows 1-2, column 1), found by matching decoded blocks against the GPU's own drawing of the bomb.
  Item menus (cheats, items, equipment, collection, capacities, magic, ammo) put the picture before the
  label (`menu_item_t.picture`, `GFX_PICTURE` + its number in the line); an option of items (ocarina,
  hookshot, big sword, gauntlets, scale, magic meter, mask slot, amiibo mask) shows the chosen one's
  (`choice_pictures`; "none" the first's, or nothing where its entry is 0, as the masks' are). Each picture's covered part (its alpha) is fitted inside its row, within the cursor's line; it's drawn a few times a fraction
  of a pixel apart, each at 1/k (their average), so it doesn't break up into noise.
- Memory. The game's heap is small (FINDINGS.md 9.6), and making the pictures needs the most of it:
  - Decoding `Common.bntx` takes its 8 MiB window, 1 MiB more to slide it back and 0.6 MiB for the decoder at
    the start, then the header (0.7 MiB) until its records are read, then the 4.6 MB of pictures it keeps
    instead. The decoder's few allocations a block (literals, sequences, Huffman and FSE tables) come from
    that 0.6 MiB (`zstd_stream_t`'s arena), so it can't run out half way while the game takes the heap. An
    icon's stream is only as big as its file (3.2 MiB at most).
  - The archive's pictures and the icons each go on without the other, and an icon that doesn't fit doesn't
    hold up the rest. What ran out of memory is tried again 10, 30, 60 and 120 s later, then every 5 minutes,
    8 times at most. Tried again, the archive's pictures' memory is taken with its stream, and it's only
    decoded if 4 MB more are free for the game then.
  - Once made, they're kept on the SD card, `sloperinaGZ/cache/pictures-<version>.bin` (4.8 MB) and
    `icons-<version>.bin` (1.2 MB): the pictures as they're drawn, after a header with what they were made from
    (this module's version, the pictures' names, the archive's size or the icon files' sizes) and a checksum,
    written last. Later starts read them (3 ms on the Mac) with no more memory than they keep. A file that
    isn't right is deleted and made afresh. The SD card's data goes through a 64 KiB buffer of the module's
    own: the file system locks the memory a call uses, and the pictures' memory may be made the GPU's at any
    moment.
  - The panels drawn on the CPU (gz's style, or the game's when its GPU drawing can't start) need 12 MB of
    buffers at 3x (23 MB with the see-through background), a block per panel. In gz's style they're taken at
    the start, else when a panel is first drawn that way; they're given back as soon as the GPU draws the
    panels, before its drawing is set up. With no memory for the menu's in gz's style, the game's style is
    used instead (and a notice says so).
- The cursor's motion follows the game's `PaOptionBtnL_00` animations (60 frames a second): `Select` (8
  frames: shown at once, alpha 0 to 1 over 4, its line and glow from 0.4 and 0.6 thinner to full, brightness
  0.74 to 1 easing out), `UnSelect` on the item left (14 frames: alpha 1 to 0 over 8, thinning back), and
  `CursorLoop` while it stays (a 40-frame loop of its material's values, a few to 25 %: here the glow dims to
  0.88 and widens by 1/8 and back). Not moving within a menu: a menu change, or opening it. A whole item's
  text changes with it: its selected look (bold, white) fades in over 4 frames as the row grows from 0.96
  to full over 8 (`gpuui_scale` about its text's start), the one left fades back as it shrinks. The gap under
  the title is taller (11 font pixels, its ornament line 0.42 down it) so the cursor's glow on the first
  item stays clear of the line.
- The game's layouts (`Common.blarc`, a SARC of `.buil` files, `Nintendo.Ui.ResModels.LayoutResData`):
  a header of tables `{u32 count, u32 8, u64 a, u64 b, u64 c}` at 0x130 (panes, materials, ...), 0x230 the
  animations (names at the u64 at 0x238, records at 0x240). An animation record: name, targets (each a
  4-byte descriptor, then u16 curve / u16 constant index, then a byte of curves, a byte of constants, a
  property byte), curves (keys' frames and (value, slope) pairs, cubic between them) and constants. Its
  materials' values are a block of floats after the material's texture list. Tools in
  `sloperina-ui/scripts` (`sarc.py`, `buil_annot.py`, `buil_anim.py`).
- In-game overlays (`overlayui.c`, in the gpuui frame under the panels): the air walls' outlines as smooth
  lines (`gpuui_line`: a quad along the line sampling a soft profile from the atlas) with a glow under the
  nearest, fading a little with distance; each enemy's health as the HUD's magic meter (`MpGaugeBase`,
  `MpGaugeBaseFrame`, `MpGaugeSh`, and `MpGaugeCenter`'s segments loaded a second time with red and green
  swapped, tinted to the hearts' red, a segment for each unit of the enemy's life (up to 12, else for each round
  step of it: 2, 5, 10...), each drawn from the picture's own segments: its light edge and dark divider at the
  meter's scale, the body tiled from their even middles; the meter and its plate on whole pixels (their thin rims
  flickered at the fractions of a pixel a turning camera put them on); `MpGaugeSh` is the shadow's left end, drawn at the meter's scale with
  the same mirrored for the right and its plain middle stretched between, so it's soft and reaches as far
  past each end as past the top and bottom), its life on the minigames' number plate (`NumBaseMiniGame` and
  its rim) in the game's bold type, the digits' bitmaps centred on the plate on a whole pixel and the slash
  (which reaches below them in this type) lifted to their middle, the part a hit takes staying pale gold for
  0.28 s and draining over 0.42;
  frame advance's icon as smooth bars and a play triangle. They share the frame's quads with the panels, so
  they're budgeted (1400 lines, 500 glows, 16 bars, the nearest first). Without its pictures (still
  loading, or not found) a bar is plain, in their colours. The game thread (airwall.c, enemyhp.c) reads
  the walls and enemies and projects them with the game's camera, making only what will be drawn: lines
  and bars while `overlayui_on_gpu()` (the game's style, its shader and type loaded, gpuui started), else
  the rectangles gz's style clears. Each frame's lines and bars go to the render thread in the same three
  buffers as its dots and rectangles (`publish.h`, as the panels' screens): the render thread takes them once a
  frame (`airwall_take`, `enemyhp_take`) and releases them after the present.
- Hidden behind Link and the scenery (`scenedepth.c`; FINDINGS.md 9.6 has the depth): each gameplay frame the
  game copies its scene depth (Depth32F at the render resolution) right after its depth pre-pass, and our
  `nvnCommandBufferCopyTextureToTexture` adds to its command buffer, right after that copy (on the console
  the game puts HUD targets over the depth's memory before the present):
  - for the health bars, 1x1 copies of the texels at four points up each enemy (enemyhp.c gives them with the
    depth the scene must be nearer than: their own, 0.5 m + 4% nearer) into a 6 KiB buffer, read two or more
    presents later behind a fence (a slot whose texels are still the marker NaN is fenced again: the game
    sometimes records the next frame's copy before this present). A bar fades out (140 ms) while all of its
    enemy's points are hidden, and in when one shows; with no results for half a second (menus) bars show.
  - for the air walls, a copy (scaled) into our own Depth32F at about the scene's resolution (5.3 MiB). At
    present time gpuui makes it Link's alone, then draws the lines into an R8 layer that size against it,
    a colour at a time, and lays the layer over the picture in that colour (sampled through a view as
    1, 1, 1, R: a colour's glow and line give the same as drawn straight on the picture). Link's alone: his
    box (airwall.c: square to the camera, 0.35 m each way round him, 0.45 adult, from 4 cm over his feet to
    his height) is a rectangle on the picture and three planes (its front, its back and the ground under
    him), each as a depth linear on the picture, so a quad's z row gives it. Into the layer: white where the
    depth is beyond the front (LEQUAL), black where it's past the back (LESS) or at the ground or under it;
    then, the depth alone bound, a quad at the far plane sampling that mask through a material that gives
    alpha 1 - mask, so it's discarded on Link and writes the far plane everywhere else (ALWAYS, writing).
    The lines' ends carry their depth (3 cm + 0.3% nearer, linear on the picture as the scene's is), so
    they hide only where Link is in front of them; the scenery never hides them (their edges lie in its
    surfaces, a little under them here and there, and are wanted through walls). The picture-sized depth
    this first used (15 MiB at 2560x1440) and an RGBA8 layer were more than the game's heap gave.
  Settings: scene > through walls (bars) and collision > through Link (lines) turn it off.
- Without the GPU path (gpuui couldn't start), the game's type is drawn on the CPU, opaque, on gz's grid.

Check the CPU drawing on the PC with `make nativepreview` and `obj/host/nativepreview <RomFS folder> out.ppm [scale]`.
Tested in nxnative on 1.0.0. Not yet tested on an emulator or a console.

## Next

- Test on a console and on emulators.
- Drop the per-frame GPU waits (`slot_finished`, `wait_gpu_idle`) now that nothing is read back in the game's style.
